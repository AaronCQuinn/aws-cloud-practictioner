What is Cloud Computing?
- The on-demand delivery of compute power, databasing, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Traditional Vs. Cloud:
- Traditional: 
  1. You would need to provision you own hardware. Requires space, staff, security, planning, large upfront cost. 
  2. Hardware procurement cycle is long (compared to cloud).
  3. Requires theoretical guess work around load capacity. Too much and your hardware lies dormant providing no benefit, too little and you can't keep with customer demands and they receive sub-optimal service.
  4. If your needs change, this cycle starts over and the planning, capital expenditure, and human resource are needed to reconfigure your hardware.
- Cloud:
  1. Enables you to think of infrastructure as software.
  2. Your cloud hardware becomes incredibly flexible, enables the ability to provision, edit or remove hardware incredibly quickly with shorter term commitment.
  3. Very little upfront cost with pay-as-you-go model.
  4. Eliminates the entire procurement, maintenance, security for physical hardware.

Types of cloud service models:
  1. Infrastructure as a service - IaaS
  2. Platform as a service - PaaS
  3. Software as a service - SaaS

Types of cloud computing deployment models:
  1. Cloud
  2. Hybrid
  3. On-premis (private-cloud)
